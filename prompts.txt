Convert this real photograph into the style of the old computer adventure game Posel Smrti (Black Mirror, 2003). Keep the original composition, architecture, environment, and all non-modern elements. Remove or visually neutralize all modern objects (modern cars, cables, plastic containers, new signs, modern windows, lights, etc.). Do not create any new objects or game elements, do not add anything. Only convert the existing elements into the style of 2003. The graphic style must match realistic early-2000s 3D-rendered graphics, with slightly outdated textures and a hint of mild grain and soft, imperfect details typical of old adventure games. Atmosphere: gloomy, autumn, melancholic, but not too dark. Lighting: daytime, afternoon sunlight, gentle soft light, light autumn shadows. Use slightly enhanced colors, but keep the environment’s dark tone. Do not add fog, characters, or effects unless they are present in the original photo.
